## Intro

Information Architecture is a method of visualizing the structure of apps and programs. Creating IA helps developers to know how people can interact with the app and design it according to the structure. If there are problems with the structure, developers can easily edit

## Kakaotalk

Kakaotalk is the most famous Social Networking System (SNS) in Korea. About 90% of Koreans use it, so it's almost like a mandatory app for them. In such a case, it is crucially important for developers to create an understandable IA that Koreans can get easily used to. Over 12 years the app has developed massively which led some parts to get more complex while other parts to get simple. I have analyzed the main IAs to determine the overall efficiency of the app.

### Friends

After logging in (Kakaotalk automatically logs in in default except when you have logged out beforehand or you are using the PC version), Kakaotalk leads you to the Friends menu. On top, there is a toolbar with four buttons. The Search and Add Friends buttons are useful to find new and existing friends when you can't find them from your long list of friends.

Right below the toolbar is your profile which people mostly click to edit their profile. After that, you have your friend list sorted out in different categories. Friends with Birthdays show friends with upcoming birthdays. Friends with Updates show who recently updated their profile. Favorties show people who you have marked as your favorites. Lastly, all of your friends are gathered in one long list.

I think it is convenient to see specific profiles ahead that helps you to interact with them. Having a lot of friends added makes it harder to keep up with everyone's status, which is why Kakaotalk had added the specific friends lists.

It would have been more efficient to move the Favorites on top of the other specific friends lists as people would prefer to contact their closer friends more often.

### Chats

Chats gather all the different types of chats. The toolbar has a Start a Chat button as well as an Open Chat button. Open chats are chatrooms where you can chat with people who you are not yet friends with. Unless they share you their profile, you won't be able to interact as friends which is a good way to keep privacy.

Other than open chats, you can normally chat with your friends as individuals or as a group. As friends, you have access to send gifts or money as well as view all of their profile information and pictures.

Although there is a search button, it is hard to find every single chatroonm through one long line. You are also only allowed to pin 5 chatrooms in the mobile version, which limits the chatrooms you can see at the top of your chats page.

### View

The View menu gathers a variety of blog channels people can view and subscribe to. Companies and organizations usually create a Kakaotalk channel in which updates subscribers with product and event news. Here you can view those updates as well as view other official blogs that are created for entertainment.

### Shopping

Shopping contains a bunch of advertisments for products. Some of them are created by Kakaotalk, but mostly are other companies trying to sell a lot. There are so many categories to choose from, which is why it can sometimes be too complicated to use the Shopping menu.

### More

The More menu gathers many more features Kakaotalk can provide. Kakao Pay is a way for Kakaotalk users to transfer, save, or spend money by registering their bank account or card information. Gifts or shopping is on there as well. There is an Emoticon shop which users can buy over a million different emoticons people create. So many complicated features are gathered here, which may seem difficult for some people to handle.

### Advertisments

Kakaotalk has added advertisements to all 5 menus. Since almost everyone is using it, many Korean companies recognize the potential value of advertising through the app. Kakaotalk also post their own advertisments for other Kakao apps as well as character merchandise.

### Conclusion

Though Kakaotalk has evolved over a long period, there are major problems with the IA design. All menus rely on scrolling down the page, which limits the amount of content people would actually find. Categorizing and
