## Introduction

---

- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world population aged over 60 years will have doubled in number by 2050, with an estimated total of 2 billion people. `WHO.AgeingandHealth(WHO,2018).`
- Currently it is estimated that 50 million are living with dementia worldwide and nearly 10 million new cases occur every year, representing a serious public health problem. `WorldHealthOrganization.Dementia(WHO,2017).`
- dementia is not considered a normal sequela of aging and prevention should be the key strategy to mitigate the identified risk factors. `Livingston,G.et al. Dementia prevention,intervention,and care: 2020 report of the Lancet Commission. TheLancet396, 413–446(2020).`

## Result

--
--Statistically significant dif- ferences were observed for the different CMG (p<0.001) and within the CMG for the different age groups for Memory Sweep (p = 0.013), Babble Bots (p < 0.001) and Unique (p < 0.001).

### CMG Scores

As for the initial scores, we observed an interesting linear trend between age and session, indicating that all participants improved in all CMG but that the progress was slower in older participants.

### CMG Scores

As for the initial scores, we observed an interesting linear trend between age and session, indicating that all participants improved in all CMG but that the progress was slower in older participants (p < 0.001 for the 7 CMG).

## Discussion

- Though the changes in different cognitive abilities over the lifespan are relatively well-documented , there is less evidence on the plasticity of these different cognitive functions across the lifespan23–25. Furthermore, it has not yet been established whether all cognitive functions can be trained or the extent to which progress can be achieved in healthy subjects of different ages.
