## Introduction

Agile, also known as Scrum, is a work method involving small repeated steps to complete a computer software or a project. [^1] Sprints are these repeated steps or iterations that designers plan to accomplish. Time is evenly distributed between sprints in order for the develop team to feel less pressure and more achievement along the way.

As the name suggests, sprints are relatively short in time. Most sprints fall in between one week to one month time periods. This shows that sprints really encourage developers to focus their effort in the tasks for every sprint. [^2]

## Practices

In order to start sprints for a project, the design team is required to follow practices that are necessary for customers to understand and be satified with. First, the story of the customers need to be identified. Then, specific requirements for the developers have to be laid out. These settings would allow developers to start coding without any misunderstanding about the project's details.

### Story

Writing a story in the customer's point of view helps to determine whether the product will be effective. If they have a certain problem or discomfort, designers aim to find a solution for them.

For example, if a customer doesn't want to spend money on every movie they watch, designers would find a solution of creating a subscription app such as Netflix that gathers millions of movies and shows for viewers to watch. [^3]

### Requirements (DOD)

Requirements, also referred as Definitions of Done (DOD), are detailed descriptions of what the developer needs to exactly create through coding. Precise measurements need to be aligned, such as angles, length, and height.

All applications that designers include need to be reasonable, or it would lead to wasting the time and effort of the developer.

It also shouldn't be focusing on what the app/program doesn't include, since the creative process can be endless. Developers need to focus on the core requirements on what the app must need in order to function properly.

This outline of the UI and fuctions would prevent any misunderstanding between the designers and developers and guide the whole product team to create the expected program.

## Conclusion

App designers and developers both have the same goal to create apps/programs that will satisfy customers in their intended ways. Agile sprints are a very effective method that breaks down the develop process. If the  designers create a smooth roadmap that guides developers with a story and DODs, they will be able to focus on every objective necessary to create the final app.
